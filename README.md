## HitBeatAssets
- Assets that the main project HitBeat! requires to function appropriately
- Comprised of object classes designed for game functionality such as Health, Beat (object to hit during gameplay), Song (pattern to display when playing a game), and Songlist (used to display all songs available for play)
- Holds necessary object classes for the video game. Increases cohesion and prioritizes single responsibility principle
  - Cohesion: How task focused a unit of code is
  - Single responsibility principle: Every module, class and method is responsible for exactly one part of the program's functionality
- Main project repository: https://github.com/minericpark/HitBeat
- Completed development in December 2017

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

- Created to learn more about Object Oriented Programming, the programming language Java, and how to utilize a game development framework
- Project utilizes custom algorithms for game mechanics such as health tracking, beat hit detection, score increase, score leaderboard, and song pacing + matching with beat patern

### Getting Started/Requirements/Prerequisites/Dependencies
- Requires LibGDX framework downloaded and attached to run
